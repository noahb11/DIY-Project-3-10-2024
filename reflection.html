This project had many highs and lows for me. While creating my original html document, I struggled to import an image. I couldn’t figure out a way to import an image without using a link, so I had to quickly change what I was writing about. Ultimately, I decided on a burger from one of my favorite restaurants because I thought that would be the easiest to accomplish; however, I struggled to find a high quality image of the specific burger I wanted to talk about. Eventually, I found a picture that was good enough by going to their facebook page, but I wasn’t sure if the image was imported properly. Luckily, that wasn’t an issue for this project. For this project, everything seemed to import smoothly.

I think one of the highs of the project was getting to go back to html after a while. I had previously taken a class that was dedicated to learning html, css, and javascript, so this was something I was vaguely familiar with already, even if it had been a while. It was nice to revisit and let me test my skills to see what I remember.

Overall, I think this helped me learn a bit more about publishing. It also helped me appreciate many of the things that go on behind the scenes for websites. While this was always something I held an admiration towards after learning html for the first time, I never realized how widespread and how valuable learning how to code could be.
